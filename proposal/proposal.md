### Project Description (1-2 pages):

Our proposed project idea is a pet journal app that would be used by pet owners to keep a log of their pet’s behaviors and other relevant information. Owners will be able to input various details about their pet. For example, if I own a dog named "Billy," I could log information such as the name, age, weight, height, breed, and any medical issues. Additionally, the app would allow users to keep a daily log of activities throughout the day. For instance, one could log: "My dog was erratic today, but didn’t eat much." This feature would be especially helpful to owners when visiting a vet, as they would have a detailed history ready for consultation. This can increase the accuracy of the vet's diagnosis should the pet become ill.

We also aim to implement a feature that utilizes a Large Language Model (LLM) to answer questions from the owner about their pet’s health and attributes. This LLM would be trained on relevant online information, and its responses would be tested for accuracy and truthfulness. For example, if the owner’s dog is a French bulldog and they ask, “Why does Billy’s right eye look odd?”, the LLM would access Billy's specific data (knowing that Billy is a French bulldog, which is prone to "cherry eye") and provide relevant information about that condition and other potential issues. This would help the owner make more informed decisions.

### Division of Work:  
- **Kevin Fasan**: Frontend, Backend  
- **Nkemjika Onwumereh**: Database, LLM  

### Programming Tools:  
- **Backend**: Python - Django  
- **Frontend**: JavaScript - React.js  
- **Database**: Firebase  
- **LLM**: Gemini / ChatGPT  

### Learning Challenges:  
The main challenge will be integrating the LLM into our website/app using API calls. We will also need to train the LLM to ensure accurate responses based on the data provided by the user.
