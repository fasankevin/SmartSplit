### **1\. Introduction** {#1.-introduction}

#### **1.1 Overview** {#1.1-overview}

SmartSplit is a mobile application designed to simplify the process of bill-splitting among friends, particularly during group dining. By taking advantage of new technologies such as Optical Character Recognition (OCR), Natural Language Processing (NLP), and payment integration APIs. By automating the receipt processing, simplifying item assignment, and integrating payment features, SmartSplit eliminates the tedious, long and often frustrating process of calculating individual contributions manually.

The main functionality of this app starts with users capturing an image of a receipt using their smartphone camera. Through OCR technology, the app scans the receipt to extract itemized details such as item names, prices, taxes, and even tips. Then NLP algorithms will then interpret this data to ensure accuracy and to handle different kinds of receipt formats. Users can then assign individual items on the receipt to specific people, mark shared items, and let the app automatically compute the totals for each participant, including taxes and tips.

The feature we believe will set SmartSplit apart from others is its integration with modern payment platforms. The app includes a built-in feature for settling payments directly, allowing users to pay their friends or complete restaurant bills using virtual cards generated by the app. This removes the hassle of managing external payment methods and provides a single, cohesive platform for all things related to handling group expenses. Additionally, SmartSplit offers a comprehensive history feature, where users can review past transactions, generate summaries for expenses tracking, and send reminders for unpaid contributions.

### **2\. General Description** {#2.-general-description}

#### **2.1 Product / Product Functions** {#2.1-product-/-product-functions}

**User Functionality**

1. Receipt Processing and Cost Assignment  
   The user starts by downloading the SmartSplit app from their device’s app store. After installing and logging into their account, users can create or join a group chat, and add friends through the phone number associated with their account. From there users can upload an image of a receipt by taking a photo directly within the app or selecting one from their device’s storage. The image of the receipt is then sent to the backend, where Optical Character Recognition (OCR) extracts the text. Natural Language Processing (NLP) further interprets the data, identifying prices, and detecting tax and tip details.  
   Once the receipt data is processed, users can assign specific items to individuals in their group. Shared Items can also be split among group members. SmartSplit then calculates each person's total, including tax and tips, and displays the breakdown for confirmation.

2. Integrated Payment System  
   Users can pay their share directly through the app. Payment processing is handled via a secure payment gateway, such as Stripe, which allows for peer-to-peer payment for restaurant bulls. The app maintains a record of all payment transactions, ensuring transparency.  
3. Expense History  
   SmartSplit stores past receipts, expense summaries, and payment records for each user, making it easy to see and track spending as well as resolve disputes. Notifications are sent to group members for pending payments, going directly to the app to settle the payment.  
   

**Staff Involvement in the System**

Although primarily for end-users, administrators (e.g staff overseeing the app's performance and customer support) will have access to the backend system to monitor app usage, troubleshoot, and perform certain maintenance tasks. This involves using admin tools to manage user accounts, address payment disputes, or resolve technical issues.

**Database Transactions for Users**

When a user logs into the app, their credentials are authenticated against a database hosted on a cloud platform like Firebase or AWS. This ensures secure access to their account and associated data. Once logged in, all user actions such as uploading a receipt , assigning items, and initiating payments are executed in real time with the database. This database stores the relevant information to do with the user, including user profiles, receipts, expense data, transaction history, ensuring scalability as well as reliable access for multiple users at the same time.

**Database Transactions for Administrators**

Administrative tools allow staff to monitor the systems activity, troubleshoot the OCR or payment processing issues, and analyse app usage metrics. Through this interface, staff can also adjust system parameters, such as receipt processing rules or payment thresholds, ensuring that the app remains functional and user-friendly.

**User Interface (UI) Functionality**

The app demonstrates an intuitive interface interface designed for simplicity and usability:

* The receipt upload screen allows users to capture or select receipt images.  
* The item assignment interface provides simple drag and drop/ drop down menu functionality for assigning items to group members   
* The payment interface simplifies sending and receiving money using the integrated APIs such as Stripe.  
* The interface will be designed using modern frameworks like Flutter or React Native, ensuring a smooth and responsive experience across different Operating Systems

**Payment Processing and Security**

Payments through the app are made possible using Stripe’s API for secure, real time transactions. Users can pay peers by peer-to-peer payments for settling balances among the group. All transactions are encrypted, and since it is through Stripe, compliance with PCI DSS standards is guaranteed to ensure user data and financial information remain secure.

#### **2.3 Operational Scenarios**  {#2.3-operational-scenarios}

1. **Member Login**

Users will be required to log into the app using their registered email and password o	through Google. Upon entering the correct credentials, the user gains access to their  
Account. If the login details are incorrect, the app will display an error message, prompting the user to try again or reset their password via a secure email verification process.

2. **Uploading a Receipt**  
   Once the user is logged in, a user can make a group chat and upload a receipt for processing.  
* Take a photo directly from the app using the device's camera.  
* Uploading an existing image from the device’s gallery

	The uploaded receipt is processed using OCR to extract the text and numbers, and   
	NLP categorises the data into items, prices, taxes, and tips. A confirmation screen  
	displays the extracted data for the user to review before proceeding.

3. **Assigning Receipt Items**  
   The app provides a user-friendly interface where users can assign items from the receipt to specific members in the group:  
* Each item can be dragged and dropped onto a group member’s name.  
* Shared items like starters can be proportionally split among selected group members. Once all items have been assigned, the app calculates each person’s total, including taxes and tips, and displays a general summary for review.  
    
4. **Requesting Payment**  
   After confirming the split, the user can send payment requests to group members.   
1. Selecting a group member from the list   
2. Sending a payment request via in app notifications or linked messaging services like email or SMS  
3. The app tracks pending payments and updates their status when completed  
   If a peer fails to pay within an amount of time, the app can automatically send reminders.  
     
5.  **Paying Peers**   
   Users can settle their share through the app:  
1. Navigate to “Pending Payments” section  
2. Select the payment request and confirm the amount  
3. Complete the transaction using a linked payment method, such as debit/credit card  
     
6. **Viewing Expense History**  
   Users can review past transactions and receipts in the “Expense History” section. Features include:  
* A searchable list of receipts by date, group, or event.  
* Detailed breakdowns of each transaction. Including assigned items, tax, and tip calculations. This ensures transparency and allows users to resolve disputes or verify payments.  
    
7. **Notifications and Alerts**  
   The app sends real time notifications to keep users informed, such as:  
* Successful receipt uploads  
* Pending payment requests  
* Payment reminders and confirmation of completed transactions  
    
8. **Administrative Access**  
   For app administrators or support staff:  
* User management: Admins can view and manage user accounts, including resetting passwords or addressing disputes over payment requests.  
* System Monitoring: Admins can access usage reports, such as the number of receipts processed, total payments made, and error logs.  
* Payment Dispute Resolution: Admins have tools to verify and mediate disputes between users, accessing relevant transaction details as needed.  
    
    
    
9. **Group Management**   
   Users can create or join groups within the app to manage recurring expenses. Features include:  
* Adding/removing group members.  
* Viewing group-specific expense histories  
* Automatically splitting recurring bills for group members
